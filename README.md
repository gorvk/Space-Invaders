## **Game Mechanism** :
Bullet are drawn infinitly on the screen. When the bullet is fired it's postion at y-axis decreases which feels like bullet is fired and moving forward.
<br>Player can shoot one bullet at a time unill it reaches the 0th position at y-axis, it gets reset to the orginial position at y-axis from where it was shoot<br> and x-axis where player is located. 
<br>This reseting of bullet works same when it hits any enemy.
<br>Enemies are drawn randomly at the starting of the game and when a bullets hit them.<br>
